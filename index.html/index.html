    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone. My name is Balogun Aneefat. I'm 23 years old. My star sign is Gemini. I love reading, watching movies, dancing in my free time. I come from a family of 6, me being the first born. I have 3 younger siblings. I'm from Kwara State, Irepodun local government area. I love neutral and cool colors. I love wearing Jewelries and looking nice. Fashion is a hugeee part of my life. Looking good is good business. I modelled for a while but I'm focused on other things right now.</p>
    <!--I'm writing about why i decided to join altschool-->
    <h3>Why i joined Altschool?</h3>
    <p>I joined Altschool Africa because I was curious about tech. I wanted to know more about tech. Also, the money involved in tech, lol. Plus a badass female cloud engineer is a huge flex and bragging right. I'm someone that finds it difficult to try new things. It was my 2023 goal to change that. That's another reason why I'm here at Altschool. I hope to expand my knowledge about tech and also be able to utilise everything I'm going to learn here.</p>
    <p>My experience so far has been a bit stressful ngl. I've had to navigate between work and school and it hasn't been the easiest. But then nothing good comes easy. I've started making some connections that I know will last a long time. I've been added to an amazing circle (Circle - 70) and everyone has been really helpful. It's also nostalgic being a student again. I even have a student id now :ALT/SOE/023/2495. I'm enjoying my experience so far. The joy of writing my first code knows no bounds. I feel like an actual software engineer!. I can't wait to learn more. If you want to join me on this exciting journey and become the best software engineer, click the link below! </p>
